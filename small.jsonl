Cole filled in at center against the Broncos, but McNabb fumbled two snaps, and three offensive linemen were penalized for false starts. While you can&#39;t blame all the false starts on the new center, it certainly doesn&#39;t make things easier for the linemen. \u00a0 The good news is that Brian Westbrook is back after missing 5 games. His performance last week against the Broncos was promising, he had 9 carries for a total of 32 yards. In his last game against Dallas, Westbrook carried the ball 13 times for 50 yards rushing. \u00a0 Does it matter that Michael Vick may not be available to play? Probably not, but we&#39;d certainly like to see him out on the field for a few key plays.\u00a0If McNabb gets hurt, Kevin Kolb\u00a0who proved himself against the Chiefs\u00a0can help the Eagles soar to victory. \u00a0 Bring out your big guns Dallas, we&#39;re flying into town with victory on our minds!

Really, that's all you could manage Donovan? That was the biggest letdown I've ever experienced in over 30 years of watching the Eagles.\r\n\r\nEarlier I wrote about Philadelphia's acquisition of Michael Vick as their backup quarterback. It's time for Vick to become their starting quarterback. That game against Dallas should be McNabb's last game as the Eagles starter. The only excitement for Eagles fans came in the first half when Vick threw a pass for 67 yards and a touchdown. That quieted the 90,000+ Cowboys fans in Arlington.\r\n\r\nWhy Andy Reid didn't leave Vick in the game after that, I'll never understand. The team was fired up and the Cowboys defense was back on their heels after that first touchdown. Why bring McNabb back into the game?

I wish Justice Alito had the same amount of courage as Joe Wilson. Alito should have said out loud the words he only mouthed, \"That&#39;s not true.\" Here&#39;s what Barack had to say to SCOTUS.  With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests - including foreign corporations - to spend without limit in our elections. I don&#39;t think American elections should be bankrolled by America&#39;s most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people. And I&#39;d urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to correct some of these problems.  I can&#39;t recall another President dissing the Supremes\u00a0in that way during a SOTU address. As soon as he says, \"with all due deference\" you know he&#39;s about to disrespect somebody. \u00a0 Here&#39;s what he had to say to the American people about healthcare reform:  It is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families that we still need health insurance reform. Yes, we do. Now, let&#39;s clear a few things up. I didn&#39;t choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt. And by now it should be fairly obvious that I didn&#39;t take on health care because it was good politics. I took on health care because of the stories I&#39;ve heard from Americans with pre-existing conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage, patients who&#39;ve been denied coverage, families - even those with insurance - who are just one illness away from financial ruin.  Here&#39;s what I heard, \"You, the American sheople were too stupid to understand why we need healthcare reform, so let me explain it to you again.\" I have never heard a President who was so focused on himself.

{"comment_count":0,"content":"In an extremely well written and well thought out editorial, Jim DeMint lays out an alternate plan for solving our Nation&#39;s biggest problems. Here are the major points with my comments in italics:  Stop all scheduled tax increases and push Congress to cut taxes across the board so no American pays more than 25 percent of their income in federal taxes. Sounds reasonable to me. Cut federal spending down to 20 percent of GDP, its post-WWII average as a share of the economy, and impose a moratorium on all earmarks until the budget is balanced.This is a great idea, but I doubt it will fly. Keep the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open to ensure that terrorists cannot be released or transferred into the United States.Obama&#39;s base would be angered if he went back on his campaign promise to close Gitmo. Protect our nation&#39;s intelligence community from civil liability stemming from the actions that prevent acts of terrorism.I&#39;m not sure I agree completely with this point. Reform entitlements to give Americans greater control over their retirement, keep our promises to seniors, and control long-term spending without raising taxes. I&#39;m all for privatizing Social Security and creating the \"lockbox\" that congress critters are always talking about. Lower health care costs without growing the government by limiting frivolous medical lawsuits and by allowing Americans to access health plans across state lines. Two excellent ideas that the Republicans need to insist on before any healthcare bill is passed. Now that they have 41 Senate votes, they might be able to get the Democrats to listen. Lower energy prices and reduce our dependence on Middle East oil by allowing exploration in Alaska and the Outer Continental Shelf.\"Drill Here, Drill Now!\" Enhance primary and secondary education by reforming the No Child Left Behind law so states have the flexibility to innovate and achieve results in the classroom. This doesn&#39;t go far enough. We need to completely repeal NCLB. In face, I think we should completely abolish the Department of Education and return control of schools to local governments and parents.  So, I agree with Senator DeMint on almost everything he said, except his plan to reform education.

The Tea Party movement is not \"anti-tax.\"   The Tea Party movement is not driven by social conservatism.  The Tea Party movement is not some subculture of bug-eyed lunatics! The Tea Party movement is a made up of individuals and organizations who believe in a government limited by the powers enumerated in the Constitution and the Tenth Amendment.

Abolish unconstitutional government programs to make the government smaller. The federal Departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development would be a good place to start.

{"comment_count":1,"content":"I am tired of writing about politics. I've been let down by both the Republican and Democrat parties. I see no Hope and Change on either side. Until the American political system is changed to allow more parties to participate in the political process, nothing will change.  I still haven't registered to vote in South Carolina (mainly because I my PA driver's license won't expire until October) and I may not register at all. I'm going to become a political dropout. Unless people ask me about my political views, I'm not going to share them anymore.  Until I decide on something else to write about, the New Trommetter Times blog is on hiatus!  Disclaimer: I'm an admitted political junkie, so I'm probably going to suffer some withdrawal. If I can't handle it, I might just have to start writing about politics again. Wish me luck!

Those words are usually followed by \"We can't do that because that's against corporate policy,\" or some such phrase.\r\nMy usual reply is \"Just because something hasn't been done before doesn't doesn't mean we shouldn't try it now.\" Whenever somebody says, \"That's against policy\" I ask them to show me the written policy in black-and-white.

{"comment_count":0,"content":"\r\n\r\nThe latest craze around my house is \"Plants vs. Zombies.\" I play it on my iPod and my kids play it on our desktop computer.\r\n\r\n\r\nZombies are attacking your house and all you've got to defend yourself is some sunflowers and a pea-shooter. But if you plant them in the right place, you can keep the zombies from getting through your door. As you progress through the game the zombies get tougher, but you get more fire power. You weapons include frozen pea shooters, wallnuts and zombie eating plants. The zombies wear traffic cones, buckets and some even dance across your lawn. When night comes, it gets even scarier...\r\n\r\nRating: 5 out of 5 stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nPosted via web from Jason's posterous\r\n\r\n","author":"jasontromm","title":"Zombies Ate My Brains!","like_count":0,"author_login":"jasontromm","blog_id":753,"date_gmt":"2010-05-16 18:51:11","author_id":762,"post_id":1018,"lang":"en","url":"jasontromm.wordpress.com\/2010\/05\/16\/zombies-ate-my-brains"}

They serve mostly what I consider to be Calabash style fried seafood and chicken.\r\n\r\nIt's mainly a drive-through\/take-out kinda place. Not much room to eat inside. They have a small patio outside. Counter service only.\r\n\r\nI was really in the mood for seafood today, so I got a fried flounder sandwich. It was very good for the price. (My entire meal including fries and a drink was under $7.) I could tell the fish was frozen, not fresh because it tasted a little \"fishy.\"\r\n\r\nI'll probably go back again to try their \"Seadog\" which is haddock dipped in beer-batter, fried and served up like a hot dog. I definitely recommend the place for quickly satisfying a seafood craving.\r\n\r\nRating: 3.5 out of 5 stars","author":"jasontromm","title":"Sea Chicken (Restaurant Review)","like_count":0,"author_login":"jasontromm","blog_id":753,"date_gmt":"2010-05-13 18:16:49","author_id":762,"post_id":1020,"lang":"en","url":"jasontromm.wordpress.com\/2010\/05\/13\/sea-chicken"}
{"comment_count":0,"content":"First Impressions:    What an awesome new game! This week, we traded in some of our old Wii games to get Super Mario Galaxy 2. It starts out with the same story line as most Mario Brothers games, Bowser has captured the Princess and taken her far, far away. This time Mario has to travel through the galaxy in a spaceship built by Lumas to find and defeat Bowser and his evil minions.  We're just getting started, but I love the game already. My six-year old has had more hours to play than I have, so he wants to tell me how to play since he's the expert now. ;-) Mario has found his old friend Yoshi. So far, he has been transformed into a cloud and a rolling boulder.  The game play on the Wii is very intuitive. It doesn't take too long to get used to all of Mario's moves. Co-play mode has been improved a lot! The 2nd player doesn't just collect star bits anymore, they play the part of a Luma that can freeze Mario's enemies in place for a short while.  Don't let yourself get frustrated just because you can't beat a particular boss. It appears there are many paths to the center of the Galaxy.
